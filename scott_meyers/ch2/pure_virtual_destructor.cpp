/*In C++, a pure virtual destructor is a virtual destructor that has no implementation and is declared using the "= 0" syntax. A pure virtual destructor is used to indicate that a class is an abstract class and cannot be instantiated on its own.

If a class has a pure virtual destructor, it is required to provide a definition for the destructor, even though the destructor has no implementation. This is because the pure virtual destructor serves as a placeholder for the derived classes to define their own destructors.

Here is an example of how a pure virtual destructor can be declared and defined in C++:

Copy code*/
class Base {
public:
    virtual ~Base() = 0;
};

Base::~Base() {}
/*In this example, the class Base has a pure virtual destructor, which is declared as virtual ~Base() = 0;. The definition of the destructor is provided as Base::~Base() {}.

It is important to note that the definition of a pure virtual destructor must be provided in the same translation unit in which it is declared, as the destructor of an abstract class cannot be defined in a derived class.

In summary, if a class has a pure virtual destructor, it is required to provide a definition for the destructor, even though the destructor has no implementation. This is because the pure virtual destructor serves as a placeholder for the derived classes to define their own destructors.

what if you dont provide the definition of destructor above
If you do not provide a definition for a pure virtual destructor, you will get a compile-time error. A pure virtual destructor is a virtual destructor that has no implementation and is declared using the "= 0" syntax. A pure virtual destructor is used to indicate that a class is an abstract class and cannot be instantiated on its own.

Here is an example of how a compile-time error will be generated if a definition for a pure virtual destructor is not provided:

Copy code*/
class Base {
public:
    virtual ~Base() = 0;
};

int main() {
    Base b;  // compile-time error
    return 0;
}
/*In this example, the class Base has a pure virtual destructor, which is declared as virtual ~Base() = 0;. However, no definition for the destructor is provided. When an object of the class Base is attempted to be created, a compile-time error is generated, as the class Base is an abstract class and cannot be instantiated.

It is important to note that the definition of a pure virtual destructor must be provided in the same translation unit in which it is declared, as the destructor of an abstract class cannot be defined in a derived class.

In summary, if a pure virtual destructor is not defined, you will get a compile-time error when attempting to create an object of the class that has the pure virtual destructor.*/
