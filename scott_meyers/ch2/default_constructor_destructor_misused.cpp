//When you try to compile this code, you will get a compiler error indicating that the copy constructor and assignment operator are not defined. This is because the "String" class does not have these functions, and the default versions provided by the compiler are not suitable for this class.

//To fix this issue, you should define your own copy constructor and assignment operator for the "String" class. For example:

// a revised String class with a copy constructor and assignment operator
